# BusinessTripCalculatorApp
It is a simple app that might help engineering companies to calculate
their expenses for sending workers to work on customer's site. It calsulates
travel costs, car or cars costs, workers labour and hotel expenses, allows to add a
profit factor. After math is done, the app allows to export the data in .txt file to 
store it in offer file or company archive or to send it with the offer to the Customer
to verify their calculatons, if customer requires that.

The app is still under construction.
For now only travel by car calculations menu work.
